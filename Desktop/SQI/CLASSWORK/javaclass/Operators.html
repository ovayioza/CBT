    //Operators in Javascript
    //Arithmetic Operators
    //Addition Operator
    console.log(30 + 15);

    //subtraction operator
    console.log(30 - 15);

    //Multiplicatin operator
    console.log(30 * 15);

    //Division Operator
    console.log(30 / 15);

    //Modulus Operator
    //Returns the remainder of a division operator
    console.log(30 % 15);

    //exponentiation operator
    //Returns the result of raising the first operamd to the power of the second operand
    console.log(5 ** 7);

    //Increment Operator
    //Increases the value of its operand by 1
    let x = 10;
    x++;
    console.log(x);

    //Decreases Operator
    //Decreases the value of its operand by 1
    let y = 10;
    y--;
    console.log(y);

    //Assignment Operators
    let a = 5;
    let b = 10;
    console.log(b);

    //Addition Assignment
    b += a; // We are assigning the value of b + a to b
    console.log(b);

    //Subtraction Assignment
    b -= a; // We are assigning the value of b - a to b
    console.log(b);

    //Multiplication Assignment
    let c = 5;
    let d = 10;
    c *= d; // We are assigning the value of c * d to c
    console.log(c)

    //Division Assignment 
    c /= d; //We are assigning the value of c / d to c
    console.log(c);

    //Modulus Assignment
    d %= c; //We are assigning the value of c % d to d
    console.log(d);

    //Exponentietion Assignment 
    let e = 5;
    let f = 2;
    e **= f; //We are assigning the value of e ** f to e
    console.log(e);

    //Comparison Operators
    let g = 10;
    let h = 20;
    console.log(g == h); //Returns true if the operands are equal

    let test = "33";
    let test2 = 33;
    console.log(test == test2 ); //Returns true if the operands are equal. It compares only the value.

    console.log(test === test2 ); //Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type. It compares the value and the data type

    console.log(g != h); //Returns true if the operands are not equal
    console.log(test != test2 ); //Returns true if the operands are not equal. It compares only the value.
    console.log(test !== test2 ); //Returns true if the operands are not equal and of the same type. It compares the value and the data type.

    let test3 = "obinna";
    let test4 = "Pelumi";
    console.log(test3 === test4); //Returns true if the left operand is the same as the right operand

    console.log(g > h); //Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
    console.log(g <= h); //Returns true if the left operand is less than  or equal to the right operand.

    //Logical Operators
    let i = 10;
    let j = 20;
    let k = 30;
    //Logical and = &&
    //Logical or = ||
    //Logical not = !
    console.log(i < j && j > k); //Returns true if both operands are true
    console.log(i < j || j > k); //Returns true if one of operands is true
    console.log(!(i < j || j > k)); //Returns true if both operands is false

    //Ternary Operator
    let l = 10;
    let m = 20;
    l === m ? alert("Yes") : alert("No");
    //What comes after the "?" is what should happen if what comes before "?" is true and what comes after ":" is what should happen if what comes before "?" if false.
